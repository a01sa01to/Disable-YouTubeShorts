# Disable-YouTubeShorts

A Chrome extension that will disable YouTube Shorts

## Why do I make this?

Because I found YouTube Shorts is difficult to use.
I can't control the video, or the video infinitely loops, or so on.

## What does the extension do?

Redirects YouTube Shorts to the original video, such as `https://www.youtube.com/shorts/**` â†’ `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=**`.

## How to use
1. Install the extension.
2. Open YouTube Shorts video **in a new tab**, or it won't work.
3. The video will be redirected ðŸ¥³
